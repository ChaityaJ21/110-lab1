# Hi, my name is Chaitya Jodhavat!
## I am a second-year student at UC San Diego!

I have been coding for **5 years** now. If I had to highlight what I most like about programming, I would say the people I have met. In contrast to the *code* I write, I usually enjoy the *team I work with* much more. As the visionary Steve Jobs once said, 
> Great things in business are never done by one person. They are done by a team of people.

I still remember the small code blocks I used to write as a kid in middle school, when I first learned how to program. One of my first projects was `Hello World`, which I remember writing in Python like so:

```
def helloWorld():
    print("Hello, world!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    helloWorld()
```

A resource that I used when I was learning how to code is W3Schools. It is a great documentation page with lots of examples. You can access it through [this link](https://w3schools.com/).

Do you want to read this again? Feel free to [scroll back up](#hi-my-name-is-chaitya-jodhavat)!

This page is hosted on GitHub pages. When pushing code to GitHub, we must include a `README.md` that highlights the contents of the repository. Want to look at this repo's readme? [Find it here](/README.md)!

These are some languages that I have programmed in before:
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- C
- HTML / CSS
- C++

Outside of coding, I also have many other interests! Here are some things I like doing, ranked by how much I enjoy them:
1. Listening to new music
2. Playing basketball
3. Going to the gym
